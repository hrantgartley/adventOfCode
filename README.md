# Setup

## Usage

```bash
./setup.sh {day}

```

- This creates a directory for the day and copies the template files into it.
  It also creates a test file for the day downloaded from the Advent of Code.

- Note: This script assumes that you have the Advent of Code session cookie
  stored in a file called `session.txt` in the same directory as the script. You
  can get the cookie from your browser's developer tools. Also curl is required

- Update: setup script works with windows powershell
